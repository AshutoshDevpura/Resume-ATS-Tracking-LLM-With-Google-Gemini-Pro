## üîë Setting Up Google API Key

This application requires a Google API key. Follow these steps to configure the environment variable securely:

1. **Duplicate the Sample Environment File**:  
   In the root directory of the project, locate the `.env_sample` file and make a copy of it, renaming the copy to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env_sample .env
   ```

2. **Add Your Google API Key**:  
   Open the newly created `.env` file in a text editor and replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Google API key:
   ```plaintext
   GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"
   ```

3. **Save the `.env` File**:  
   Ensure the `.env` file is saved in the project‚Äôs root directory. This file will be automatically loaded at runtime to provide the Google API key securely.
